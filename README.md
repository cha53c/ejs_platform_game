# ejs_platform_game
Platform Game Project typed from 2nd edition Eloquent Javascript

Provided as a single HTML page. Can be run by opening index.html in a browser

This is as almost an exact transcript other than I added ```level-adaptor.js``` so you can use the ```level.js``` file from the 3rd edition.
which I invoke in the ```runGame``` function. As this is just a case of substituting a few characters it should work with game plans for either 2nd or 3rd editions


Not tested it much, but it seems to work
